### Problem Statement: Online Judge Platform

- **Objective**:

  To develop a comprehensive and user-friendly online judge platform using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack that allows users to practice coding problems, participate in competitive programming contests, and improve their algorithmic skills.

### Background:

Competitive programming platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, and LeetCode have become essential tools for developers to hone their coding skills, prepare for technical interviews, and participate in coding competitions. These platforms provide a wide range of problems, from basic programming exercises to complex algorithmic challenges, allowing users to test their skills and compete with others globally.

### Features:

### Here are some key features:

- **User Authentication and Profiles**:

  - Secure user registration and login.
  - User profiles displaying solved problems, ranking, and achievements.
  - User statistics and progress tracking.

- **Problem Management**:

  - A rich library of coding problems categorized by difficulty, topic, and tags.
  - Problem description, input/output specifications, and example test cases.
  - **Admin interface to add, update, and delete problems**.

- **Code Editor and Submission**:

  - Integrated code editor supporting multiple programming languages (Atlest 3 as of now).
  - Code submission feature with real-time feedback.
  - Execution environment to run user code against predefined test cases.

- **Contests and Leaderboards**:

  - Functionality to host and manage coding contests and hackathons.
  - Real-time leaderboards displaying user rankings and scores.
  - Contest archives for users to practice past problems.

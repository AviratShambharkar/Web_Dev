### Problem Statement: Online Judge Platform

- Objective:

  To develop a comprehensive and user-friendly online judge platform using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack that allows users to practice coding problems, participate in competitive programming contests, and improve their algorithmic skills.

- Background:

  Competitive programming platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, and LeetCode have become essential tools for developers to hone their coding skills, prepare for technical interviews, and participate in coding competitions. These platforms provide a wide range of problems, from basic programming exercises to complex algorithmic challenges, allowing users to test their skills and compete with others globally.
